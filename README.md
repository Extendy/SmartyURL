For instance, you can create a unified link for mobile app downloads, dynamically adjusting the destination URL based on the user's device, whether it runs on Android or iOS. This ensures users are directed to the appropriate download link from the official store, tailored to their operating system.

**Visitors IP Country detection**

SmartyURL uses the `ip2location/ip2location-php` library to determine visitors country based on their IP addresses. It includes the free "IP2Locationâ„¢ LITE IP-COUNTRY Database" for both personal and commercial use. For enhanced geographical redirect conditions with more accurate and up-to-date IP-based country data or if you need more accuracy consider purchasing a licensed IP2Location database. Refer to [IP2Location Database Docs](_docs/ip2location.md) for more details.
