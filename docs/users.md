# SmartyURL Users

## User Groups

To use SmartyURL, you need a user account. Users are grouped based on their permissions into user group. In any new fresh SmartyURL installation, there are three default user groups:

1. **Superadmin:** Users in this group have full control over the system as super administrators.

2. **Admin:** Users in this group can act as moderators in the system.

3. **User:** Users in this group can create URLs and manage them.

In SmartyURL, each user in a specific user group has the same permissions. For example, in the superadmin user group, every user shares identical permissions.

## Accessing URLs

Website visitors can visit created URLs without needing an account. They simply need to know the URL and can use it in any web browser without logging in. After applying any specified redirect conditions, they will be redirected to the original links.

## Creating Users

By default, SmartyURL is designed to operate as A closed application. This means that new user registrations cannot be done without authorization from the superadmin. Users are unable to create new accounts on their own; instead, a superadmin must create an account for them.

If you're a superadmin,and you need to create new user account you can add new users by logging into your account. Simply go to the sidebar, select 'Add New User' from the System Users dropdown menu. Enter the new user's information, select their user group and password. After that, you can share the login details with the user for them to access their account.

## Managing Users

By default, only superadmin users can manage other users. To create new users, modify account information (including passwords), or delete user accounts, you must have superadmin privileges.

## Why SmartyURL is Closed by Default

SmartyURL is designed with the assumption that it's typically used by a single company, a team, or a group of users. That's why, by default, SmartyURL starts as a closed application. Users can't create new accounts without authorization from the superadmin, who is responsible for creating new user accounts.

If you wish to enable public registration (while it's **not recommended**), you can do so by adjusting certain configurations.
