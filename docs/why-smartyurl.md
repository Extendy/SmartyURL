Users may be hesitant to trust shortened URLs created through public shortening services for several reasons:

1. **Security Concerns:** Shortened URLs hide the original destination, making it easier for malicious actors to disguise harmful links. Users may be cautious about clicking on links when they can't see where they lead. Especially those links known to be associated with domains belonging to companies specialized in link shortening.

2. **Phishing Risks:** Shortened URLs can be used in phishing attacks to trick users into visiting fake websites that mimic legitimate ones. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the authenticity of the destination.

3. **Link Longevity:** Public URL shortening services may shut down or change their policies, leading to broken or expired links. Users may worry about the reliability and longevity of the links they click.

4. **Lack of Information:** Shortened URLs typically do not provide information about the destination website, making it challenging for users to assess the trustworthiness of the link.

5. **Privacy Concerns:** Users might be uncomfortable with the tracking capabilities often associated with public URL shorteners. These services can collect data on users' clicking behavior, raising privacy concerns.
