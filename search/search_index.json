This functionality relies on the IP2Location database provided by IP2Location.com. Since SmartyURL is open-source and freely distributed, we include the \"IP2Location\u2122 LITE IP-COUNTRY Database,\" which is free for both personal and commercial use.</p> <p>It's important to note that while the IP2Location\u2122 LITE IP-COUNTRY Database is a valuable resource, it's essential to be aware that it may not consistently offer the highest degree of accuracy or the most up-to-date information. If you have plans to extensively employ geographical redirect conditions and demand a more precise and current dataset for IP-based country information, we strongly advise considering the purchase of a licensed version of the IP2Location database from ip2location.com. This paid version ensures you have access to the most accurate and regularly updated data for your geographical redirection needs.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can continue with the included free LITE version, although it's not fully accurate, it can still be helpful.</p> <p>If you want to use the paid version of IP2Location database:</p> <p>The paid IP2Location database offers improved accuracy and regular updates. To obtain your license and database, please visit ip2location.com/database/ip2location.</p> <p>Once you've obtained the IP2Location\u2122 IP-Country Database, download the .BIN file associated with the database and upload it to your server. Then, specify the path to the uploaded file by configuring the <code>$ip2location_bin_file</code> in <code>app/Config/Smartyurl.php</code>.</p> <pre><code>public $ip2location_bin_file =  APPPATH . \"../datastore/\". 'IP2Location/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.IPV6.BIN';\n</code></pre> <p>The uploaded BIN file should be the standard version provided by IP2Location.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>When uploading your custom IP2Location BIN file, please do not overwrite the default 'IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.BIN' file. Instead, upload it with a new filename and adjust the <code>ip2location_bin_file</code> setting accordingly. This will ensures that your file won't be overwritten when SmartyURL is updated to a new version in the future.</p> <p>This setup ensures that SmartyURL uses the paid, more accurate, and regularly updated IP2Location database for enhanced country detection.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When using the paid version of IP2Location, please remember to manually update the database (.BIN) file regularly whenever IP2Location announces a database update. This process is not handled automaticlly by SmartyURL, so it's important to stay informed about IP2Location announcements.</p>"},{"location":"legalnotice/","title":"Legal Notice","text":""},{"location":"legalnotice/#smartyurl-legal-notice","title":"SmartyURL Legal Notice","text":"<p>To offer you SmartyURL features, we leverage third-party tools and libraries, including the following:</p> <ul> <li>CodeIgniter framework ,  Copyright (c) 2019-2023 CodeIgniter Foundation, MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>CodeIgniter Shiled, Copyright (c) 2021 Lonnie Ezell, MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>CodeIgniter Settings, Copyright (c) 2021 Lonnie Ezell, MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>SmartyURL uses AdminLTE for UI, Copyright (c) 2014-2023 ColorlibHQ , MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>IP2Location-PHP-Module, Copyright (C) 2005-2023 by IP2Location.com, MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>Laminas/Escaper Copyright (c) 2020 Laminas Project a Series of LF Projects, LLC. , BSD 3-Clause \u201cNew\u201d or \u201cRevised\u201d License https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/.</li> <li>MobileDetect , Copyright (c) 2021 \u015eerban Ghi\u0163\u0103, Nick Ilyin and contributors. , MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> <li>chillerlan/php-qrcode Copyright (c) 2015 Smiley smiley@chillerlan.net , MIT License https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"legalnotice/#trademark-notice","title":"Trademark Notice","text":"<p>The word \"QR Code\" is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED https://www.qrcode.com/en/faq.html#patentH2Title</p>"},{"location":"license/","title":"SmartyURL license","text":"<p>SmartyURL is licensed under the MIT License</p> <pre><code>\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Mohammed AlShannaq\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
